# Job-Quality-in-the-South
An analysis of various job quality elements for workers in Hillsborough County, FL and Orange County, FL

This analysis combines several data sources to analyze job quality charactersitics at the county level. 
I've included the statics used in the report directly in the comments for reference, as well as the non-CPS data sources the data is being pulled from.
For any questions or concerns, please reach out to me at kodumosu@urban.org.
